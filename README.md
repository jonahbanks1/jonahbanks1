- 👋 Hi, my name is Chukwuemeka Jonah and I am a complete engineer.
-    Yes.
- I have a bachelors' degree in mechanical engineering. 
- Fully proficient in fundamentals of design, systems and equilibrium.
- I currently work as a technical support engineer at Micro focus (formerly Hewlett Packard Enterprise) - (IT Operations Management suite). 
- I advise on policy constraints for our enterpise products and resolve technical issues for our (enterprise) clients, while maintaining healthy relationships with the "Accounts" at all times through a mixture of clear communication and technical competence. 


- I am a creative probelm-solver or as I would prefer to call it - "solutions analyst" and attentive listener, this allows me to analyze and identify root-cause of problems in relationships and machines faster. 
- I want to apply my "growth-hacking" mentality to business problems for partners and employers, leveraging on my knowledge of artificial intelligence and data analysis. 
- 👀 I’m passionate about the field of data science.
- My strong mathematical and analytical educational background enables me to quickly discover trends in seemingly chaotic incident samples.
- I am also exceptionally skilled at reporting and maintaining stakeholder relationships which positions me uniquely to convey data insights to the interested parties in well written manner and clear - dynamic visuals. 



- 🌱 I’m currently learning about devops and Big data, to be more familar with the industry-standard tools for data extraction, loading and transformation at scale and deploying ML code to production environments. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any exciting projects involving Python, SQL, Artificial intelligence and web development...
- But more importantly, I am open to full-time positions in the Data analytics space.
Cheers,

Chukwuemeka Jonah.
